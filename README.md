## Description


This project is a gaming website centered around the theme of Hanukkah. Any registered player on the site can view their scores as well as those of other players. Additionally, users have the ability to access detailed profiles showcasing their performance statistics for each game, such as the number of wins and losses. 

**Memory Game**

In this game, the player must flip two cards at a time and attempt to match all pairs within the given time limit. The game consists of three levels: Level 1 with 12 cards and a time limit of 50 seconds, Level 2 with 16 cards and a time limit of 40 seconds, and Level 3 with 20 cards and a time limit of 30 seconds. Upon successfully completing a level, players can progress to the next level. However, if a level is not completed, players have the option to replay the same level as many times as needed until successfully completed

**Hangman Game**

The second game is a hangman-style game. Players aim to guess a hidden word by selecting letters. However, with each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is added. The objective is to discover all the letters in the word before the hangman's drawing is complete. If the drawing is finished and the word remains undiscovered, the player loses. Players have the option to play as many times as they desire.

In both games, each time the player wins, their score increases by one point.
